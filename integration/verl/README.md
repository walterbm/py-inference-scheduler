# verl Integration with py-inference-scheduler

## Compatibility Notice

**This integration is designed specifically for [verl v0.7.1](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/releases/tag/v0.7.1).** 

It utilizes internal API signatures (such as `load_balancer_handle` and specific `_acquire_server` patterns) that were introduced or modified in this release. It is **not backwards compatible** with earlier versions of verl and may require updates for future releases.

## Architecture

`verl` manages its own set of Ray Actors for rollouts. By default, it uses a simple LRU cache or least-requests routing. This integration overrides `verl`'s `AgentLoopManager` to delegate routing decisions to the `py-inference-scheduler` engine.

Key components:
- [verl_hook.py](./verl_hook.py): Contains `InferenceSchedulerServerManager` and `PyInferenceAgentLoopManager` which are injected into the `verl` training loop.
- `InflightStore`: Tracks active requests per worker in real-time to augment slow Prometheus metrics.
- `backends/verl/`: Contains monkey-patches for `vllm` and `sglang` to enable metrics extraction and correct environment propagation.
- `datalayer/metrics/verl/`: Contains backend-specific logic (HTTP scraping) to fetch and parse metrics from the workers.

## Prerequisites & Cluster Requirements (Step 1)

Before integrating the scheduler, you must set up a Ray cluster and ensure specific infrastructure conditions are met. If your cluster already satisfies the prerequisites and works with verl, skip to [Integration Configuration](#integration-configuration-step-2).

### Environment & Images
*   **Ray Cluster**: You must have a running Ray cluster. For setup instructions, refer to:
    *   [verl Installation Guide](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html)
    *   [verl Multinode VM Setup](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/multinode.html)
    *   [KubeRay verl Post-Training Guide (K8s)](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/examples/verl-post-training.html)
*   **Supported Images**: We strongly recommend using the official pre-built verl images, as they come pre-configured with all necessary dependencies:
    *   **vLLM Backend**: `verlai/verl:vllm011.latest`
    *   **SGLang Backend**: `verlai/verl:sgl059.latest`
> [!NOTE]
> If you must use a custom image, you must ensure that the vLLM or SGLang versions match those in the official images, and that **`verl==0.7.1`** is installed in the environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You must configure the following resources when creating your Ray cluster:**
> *   **Shared Metrics Directory**: The integration requires a shared, writable directory for Prometheus multiproc metrics.
>     *   **Kubernetes (K8s)**: You must define a shared volume (e.g., an `emptyDir` named `metrics-dir`) and mount it at `/tmp/metrics` on **both** the head and all worker pods.
>     *   **Non-Kubernetes (VMs)**: A directory (defaulting to `/tmp/metrics`) must exist and be writable by the Ray process on **every** node in the cluster.
> *   **Scheduler Config Visibility (K8s Only)**: If running on K8s, a ConfigMap named `scheduler-config` (containing your `scheduler.yaml`) must be mounted to `/etc/scheduler` on all pods.
>     *   *Reference*: See [verl-inference-scheduler.yaml](./examples/verl-inference-scheduler.yaml#L55-L56) to see how these mounts are configured.
>     *   The ConfigMap must be applied **before** deploying the cluster. Failing to do so will cause the pods to get stuck in a `CreateContainerConfigError` state. Refer to [Custom Configuration on Kubernetes (K8s)](#custom-configuration-on-kubernetes-k8s) for instructions on how to apply it.

### Dataset Preprocessing
*   **Your own Training Script**: Ensure your own training dataset is preprocessed and stored in a location accessible by all Ray worker nodes (e.g., via a PVC, GCS bucket, or shared NFS).
*   **Walkthrough Example (Optional)**: If you don't have a dataset and would like to follow along this integration with an example, you can use verl's preprocessed GSM8K/MATH datasets. Refer to the [verl Quickstart Data Preparation](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/quickstart.html) for instructions.
> [!WARNING]
> **Data Path Alignment for walkthrough script**: Our example training scripts contain hardcoded paths (e.g., `/home/ray/data/...`). You must ensure your preprocessed data is mounted/copied to this exact path on the workers, or edit the path variables at the top of the scripts before running them.

---

## Integration Configuration (Step 2)

The scheduler configuration (`scheduler.yaml`) must be made visible to the Ray job. Choose one of the following paths depending on your customization needs:

### Default Configuration
By default, the integration uses the `scheduler.yaml` bundled with the repository, located at `integration/verl/examples/scheduler.yaml` relative to the repository root. This is resolved automatically by the default `runtime_env` configuration.

You can use our default [runtime-env.yaml](./examples/runtime-env.yaml) file:
```yaml
working_dir: "https://github.com/llm-d-incubation/py-inference-scheduler/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
env_vars:
  PYTHONPATH: "."
  PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR: "/tmp/metrics"
  ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH: "./integration/verl/examples/scheduler.yaml" # Relative to CWD (repo root)
```
Ray unpacks the zip, sets the CWD to the repo root, and resolves the relative path to the default config.

### Custom Configuration on Kubernetes (K8s)
If you want to customize the scheduler settings on K8s:
*   Modify the [scheduler_config.yaml](../../configs/scheduler_config.yaml) ConfigMap manifest locally.
*   Apply the updated ConfigMap to your cluster:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configs/scheduler_config.yaml
    ```
*   **Update [runtime-env.yaml](./examples/runtime-env.yaml)**: You **must** change `ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH` to the absolute mount path:
    ```yaml
    env_vars:
      ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH: "/etc/scheduler/scheduler.yaml" # Absolute path to K8s mount, or wherever your scheduler config resides
    ```

### Custom Configuration on VMs (Non-K8s)
If you want to customize the scheduler settings in a VM-based cluster:
*   **Clone the repository** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/llm-d-incubation/py-inference-scheduler.git
    cd py-inference-scheduler
    ```
*   **Modify the configuration** locally at `integration/verl/examples/scheduler.yaml`.
*   **Update [runtime-env.yaml](./examples/runtime-env.yaml)** to use your local directory as the `working_dir` (using `.`):
    ```yaml
    working_dir: "." # Packages the local repo root when submitted from there
    pip:
      - "verl==0.7.1"
    env_vars:
      PYTHONPATH: "."
      PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR: "/tmp/metrics"
      ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH: "./integration/verl/examples/scheduler.yaml" # Relative to CWD (repo root)
    ```
*   **Submit the job from the repository root** (see Section 3). Running from the root with `working_dir: "."` ensures Ray packages the entire repository (including the `scheduling` source code and your modified config), preventing import errors on the workers.

> [!TIP]
> **Designing Custom Profiles**: To learn more about the available scorers, filters, pickers, and flow-control plugins you can use to customize your scheduling policies, refer to the comprehensive [Scheduler Customization Guide](../../docs/scheduler_customization.md).

---

## Running a Training Job (Step 3)

You submit training jobs to the Ray cluster using `ray job submit`.

### Connecting to the Cluster
Ensure your Ray cluster is running, then establish connection:
*   **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Once your pods are in the `Running` state, open a local tunnel to the Ray Head Node dashboard:
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward svc/<ray-head-svc-name> 8265:8265 -n <namespace> &
    export RAY_ADDRESS="http://127.0.0.1:8265"
    ```
*   **Non-Kubernetes (VMs)**: Ensure you have network access to the Ray Head node, and export its address:
    ```bash
    export RAY_ADDRESS="http://<head-node-ip>:8265"
    ```

### Submission Commands
Ensure you are in the directory containing your configured [runtime-env.yaml](./examples/runtime-env.yaml) (or the repository root if using `working_dir: "."`).

*   **Your own Training Script**:
    Submit your job by pointing to your custom Python script and passing the required integration flags:
    ```bash
    ray job submit \
        --address http://localhost:8265 \
        --runtime-env integration/verl/examples/runtime-env.yaml \
        -- python3 path/to/your/custom_training_script.py \
            --your-training-flags... \
            actor_rollout_ref.rollout.disable_log_stats=False \
            +actor_rollout_ref.rollout.agent.agent_loop_manager_class=integration.verl.verl_hook.PyInferenceAgentLoopManager  # This override registers our custom scheduler hook with verl
    ```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Required Flags for your own scripts**:
> If you are writing your own training script, you **must** pass the following flags to `python3 -m verl.trainer.main_ppo` for the integration to function:
> *   `+actor_rollout_ref.rollout.agent.agent_loop_manager_class=integration.verl.verl_hook.PyInferenceAgentLoopManager`
>     *   *Purpose*: Registers our custom scheduler hook with verl.
> *   `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.disable_log_stats=False`
>     *   *Purpose*: Enables logging of statistics necessary for metrics parsing.
> *   `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.prometheus.enable=True` (**SGLang Only**)
>     *   *Purpose*: Required for SGLang to enable the Prometheus metrics endpoint. Without this, the scheduler cannot retrieve backend stats.

*   **Walkthrough Example (Optional)**:
    Submit the job by pointing to one of our pre-configured shell scripts (which already include the required flags):
    ```bash
    ray job submit \
        --address http://localhost:8265 \
        --runtime-env integration/verl/examples/runtime-env.yaml \
        -- bash integration/verl/examples/run_qwen2_5-32b_math.sh
    ```
    *(Replace `run_qwen2_5-32b_math.sh` with `run_qwen2_5-32b_math_sglang.sh` if using the SGLang backend).*
> [!WARNING]
> **Resource Alignment**: If you're following walkthrough example, ensure the resource allocation flags in your training script (e.g., `trainer.n_gpus_per_node`, `trainer.nnodes`, and `tensor_model_parallel_size`) exactly match your Ray cluster's physical resources. Mismatches will cause the job to hang indefinitely in Ray or fail with OOMs.

---

## 4. Verifying Results (Step 4)

Once the job is submitted, you can monitor its progress:

*   Open the Ray Dashboard (typically at `http://localhost:8265`).
*   Check the **Jobs** tab and view the logs for your submission.
*   If the scheduler is active and making decisions, you will see logs indicating config reloads (if modified) and routing decisions in the worker/driver logs.

Viewing the logs on the actual ray submit job where you've ran the training job is the best place for logs. This can be found either in the *Overview* or *Jobs* tab of the Ray Dashboard (localhost:8265). verl gives us output by step. Don't be concerned if you see `ppo` tags on the labels for the logs—veRL uses the same testing infrastructure for its GRPO and PPO runs. Our script is a GRPO trainer. Enabling the scheduler does not change verl's standard telemetry behavior - if you have your `WANDB_API_KEY` set, metrics will still populate in Weights & Biases as normal.

Logs look as follows (from verl-vllm using gsm8k):

```

Key metrics to look out for are `perf/throughput` for sampling throughput and `timing_s/agent_loop/slowest/generate_sequences` for your tail latency. Additionally, if you enable preemptions, `timing_s/agent_loop/slowest/num_preempted` can be useful too.
