    Helper function to score endpoints relative to each other based on a numeric metric.

        endpoints: A sequence or dictionary values of Endpoint objects.
        metric_extractor: A callable that takes an Endpoint and returns a float metric.
        lower_is_better: If True, lower metric values receive higher scores (close to 1.0).
